# Yahoo_Redesign_MockUp

This is an old exercise from Wyncode were we tried to implement a mockup design with HTML and CSS. <br/>
This project uses Font Awesome, Normalize CSS and Google Fonts. Unfortunately does not follow best practices like mobile first design/development nor follow any queries that will re-arrange the contents to fit different screen sizes.
